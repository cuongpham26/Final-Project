    <h1>Phishing</h1>

    <p>Phishing is an extremely common online scam that tries to get your personal information. 
    These are mainly done in the form of spam emails that try to get you to click on links or to download files.</p>

    <p>These can be extremely dangerous to both the individual who gets phished and also the company that they work for.</p>
    <p>There are a few different ways to try and avoid getting phished:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Don't click on random links sent to you</li>
      <li>If you do click on a link and it sends you to a log in page check the URL to see if it's legitimate</li>
      <li>If the email requires your immediate action by using words phrases like "Contact us immediately" or "Action required"</li>
      <li>Verify that the email is legitimate through the companies website by calling or emailing them, dont click on the link</li>
    </ol>  
    <p>Here are some example emails, decide whether these emails are a phishing email or if they are safe</p>
    <p><i>Hint: Hover over the links to see the link address</i></p>
